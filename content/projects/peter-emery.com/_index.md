## First analysis

The peter-emery.com website is already well designed, easy to navigate, and easy to search for. Images are usually loaded on demand, saving transfer size when they aren't required. Smaller images are returned to devices with smaller screen sizes (mobile phones / tablets), also saving transfer size. The site is a Progressive Web App, which improves caching and hence reduces data transfer. As with everything though, when you take a long and detailed look there are improvements that can be made.

## Second analysis

At this point, it was decided that it would be better to rewrite the webiste from scratch, instead of incrementally improving the existing one. The website was custom built, and expensive to maintain, so moving to an off the shelf website template (from Fabrik.io) reduces this maintenance cost, and should come with current best practice out of the box. The metrics were vastly improved at this point, mostly due to reducing the number of pages on the site.
