A hard refresh clears your browser cache for a specific page, which forces it to load the most recent version of that page.

Clicking the "Refresh" icon on the address bar performs a soft refresh, which gets the most recent version of the page, but not of any of the things that it references.

Here's how to do hard refresh:

**Google Chrome**

- Windows: hold down Ctrl and then press F5 on your keyboard
- Mac: hold down Cmd and Shift and then press R on your keyboard

**Firefox**

- Windows: hold down Ctrl and then press F5 on your keyboard

- Mac: hold down Cmd and Shift and then press R on your keyboard

**Safari (Mac)**

- Go to Safari > Empty Cache, or hit Opt + Cmd + E
- To refresh, click the refresh button on the address bar or press Cmd + R

**Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge (Windows)**

- Hold down Ctrl and then press F5 on your keyboard
