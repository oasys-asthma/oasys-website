---

The Oasys team have published a large number of papers about Oasys and about occupational asthma more generally.

We have also collated a list of over 5000 relevant papers, over 2,500 with abstracts. These can be downloaded in Medline format for use with reference management software, such as Cite while you write and Reference Manager.

Many of these have been converted from a Reference Manager Database which was largely hand entered. Please excuse any typing errors.
