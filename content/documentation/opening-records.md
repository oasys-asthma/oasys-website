---

To open files from the internet click on "File - Open From Oasys Server". A new window will open showing all your files (including the 4 example files that ship with Oasys).

The window will open in "Simple" mode, which is described on this page. For more advanced options please see [opening records in advanced mode](/documentation/opening-records-advanced) for more details.

To open a single record in the list you can double click it, or single click it and then click "Open".

You can select multiple records in the list by left dragging an area with the left mouse button or by holding down Shift or Ctrl while single clicking (standard Windows idioms). To open all the selected files click "Open".
