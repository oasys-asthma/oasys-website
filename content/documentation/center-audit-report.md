To view the audit report for your lab / office / hospital / clinic / workplace click on "View - Oasys Audit Center Report". 

Any auditing period can be chosen, Oasys defaults to showing you the previous full year.

The audit report is generated from all the patients and records in your patient details file (which can be shared by multiple employees in an organisation).

### Record Details

These details are entered as part of saving the Oasys records, no further data entry is required. The table below shows some of the data in this section with some comments.

The "Number of records" counts records that have a start date in the auditing period.

The "Number of New Patients" counts patients whose earliest record has a start date in the auditing period.

The "Average records per New Patient" counts the total number of records for each New Patient, even if they are after the auditing period. Most people will need more than one record during the course of their diagnosis and management. If you are running the report for a recent period the patients will not have had time to do multiple records, so it is worth re running this, probably yearly, to see how the new patients in each year are analysed.

The "Average number of rest days per record" averages the rest days across the records.	Rest day are as important (or more) than work days in records, as Oasys needs something to compare the work days to. If this figure is low then you can think about ways to instruct your patients that lead to better outcomes.

The "Optimal quality for at least one of the Oasys scores" counts records that are good quality for at least one of the automatic Oasys scores.	If this figure is low then you can think about ways to instruct your patients that lead to better outcomes.

### Common Workplaces

This table shows a list of the workplaces for your new patients (in the auditing period) along with how many patients are at each workplace. High numbers of patients (this could be 2 for a small employer) with positive records is a good reason to investigate further. Only workplaces with at least 2 patients are shown

### Demographics

The data in this section is entered from the Oasys Audit Patient Data window.

The denominator for this data is the number of new patients that have anything other than "Not Sure" entered. So it only counts new patients for which you have entered any data.

Smoking history, atopy and any previous asthma (when investigation for occupational asthma) are presented.

### Methods of Diagnosis

The results of Specific IgE tests and Specific Inhalation Challenge tests are entered as part of the agent data in the Patient Demographics and / or the Oasys Audit Patient Data windows.

The rest of the Diagnosis data is entered in the  Oasys Audit Patient Data window.

The PD20, IgE and Specific Inhalation Challenge tests will not be available in all labs, but asking patients if their symptoms improve on weekends and or on holidays is possible (and recommended) for everybody.

The denominator for this data is the number of new patients that have anything other than "Not Sure" entered. So it only counts new patients for which you have entered any data.

### BTS Audit Guidelines

The British Thoracic Society's standards of care for occupational asthma state that all patients with suspected occupational asthma should have certain investigations done and documented in the notes by the patient's second visit. See Standards of care for occupational asthma for more details.
