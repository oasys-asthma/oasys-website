description: "Sensitivity and specificity in Oasys"
---

In the documentation for Oasys, we talk about specificity and sensitivity quite a lot.

In this context the terms relate to how good a test is at diagnosing occupational asthma.

Specificity is the percentage of patients that have no problems with occupational asthma that are correctly identified as not having a problem. So a specificty of 92% means that 8% of patients without occupational asthma are falsely identified as having occupational asthma.

Sensitivity is the percentage of patients with occupational asthma that are correctly identified as having occupational asthma. So a sensitivity of 77% means that 23% of people with occupational asthma will not be identified using the test.
