The best way to share records with co workers is to share your patient details file (so that they can see and update the personally identifiable details for patients), and to assign them permissions. Please see [sharing Patient Details](/documentation/sharing-patient-details) for more details.

Sometimes you may wish to share records externallly, say by email, for example to get an opinion from a colleague in another hospital. In this case you can export a new patient details file which can then be emailed. You can choose to anonymise the details to preserve confidentiality.

To start click on "Tools - Import Patient Details" from the main menu. A new window will appear. A wizard will guide you through the steps involved, as described below.

### Step 2 - Record Conflicts

If there is nothing displayed on this step simply click "Next" to move on.

Records listed here already exist in your patient details file and are different in the file you are importing. Your current values are shown in brackets after the values from the file to import. A padlock symbol is shown if this record will be read only when you import it.

This step only checks if the record details are different, patient names are checked in the next step. The patient names shown here will always be from your existing patient details file to make recognition easier. The workplace, height, start date, end date and patient are replaced when importing. The start date and end date will correct themselves if necessary next time the record is saved.

Tick the records that you would like the importing file to overwrite and click "Next" to continue.
