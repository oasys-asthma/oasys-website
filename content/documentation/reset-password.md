Type in your email address and click on "Request Reset". An email will be sent to your email address with a secret token to reset your password.

When the email arrives, copy the token from the email in to "Token from email", and then enter your new password.

The text on the right is grey when there is a problem (for example that the password isn't long enough), and turns green when everything is ok.

To finish, click on "Reset Password".
