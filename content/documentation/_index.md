We hope that you find Oasys useful and easy to use. If you are having trouble please browse the website. Listed below are some common issues that new users of the program have. At the bottom of the page are links to other sections of the help.

Oasys saves all personally identifiable information to your computer and all anonymous information to a database in the cloud. We aim to use this information to further the understanding of occupational asthma. The system complies with UK data protection law. If you want more information about this please see [Data protection in Oasys](/documentation/data-protection).

### The program wants me to Log In - what do I do?

To use Oasys you must first [create an account](/documentation/sign-up). We will not disclose your email address to anyone else and will never send you marketing emails.

If you have already registered with the website but have forgotten your password you can [reset your password](/documentation/reset-password)

{{< /middle-section-1  >}}

### I have logged in, now what?

The first thing new users will want to do is to start a new record (see [Creating a new record](/documentation/creating-a-new-record) for more details, or read the summary below) . If you are working in an office with others you may want to set up a patient details file that you all share. See the section on [sharing patient details](/documentation/sharing-patient-details) for details.

To start a new record click on "File - New Internet Record". A new window will open. You can choose to enter a record from one of your previous patients, but since this is your first one there are none available. Click on "Patient Info" and enter the the patients details. If you know the height, sex and date of birth of the patient enter these and click on "Calculate Predicteds" so that Oasys works out the predicted peak flow. You also enter the start date of the record here. Click on "Record Info" and enter treatment and meter details. Click on "Workplace" and enter job, employer and exposure details. Then click on "OK".

If you wish to change any of these demographic details later on simply click on "View - Patient Demographics" (See [Patient Demographics](/documentation/patient-demographics) for more details). You may also wish to add [Clinical / Audit Demographics](/documentation/editing-patient-audit-data).

A new record will be created and you will be taken to the [data sheet](/documentation/data-sheet) where you can enter the peak flow measurements. You can also import readings from some electronic meters if you have the relevant version of Oasys installed.

Click on "File - Save" every now and then to save the record.

### I have finished entering the record, how do I see the report?

Click on "View - Report". See the [Oasys report](/documentation/oasys-report) section to find out what everything means.

### Oasys has lost my login details - help!

If you have not saved a file for a an hour or two Oasys will log you out for security reasons.

If this happens simply click on "File - Log On to the Oasys Server" to log on and then try again.

### How do I open records?

If you have used Oasys before then you will already have same some records. Or maybe you are sharing a patient details file with colleagues and you would like to look at records they have saved. Click on [Opening records](/documentation/opening-records) for more details or read the summary below.

Click on "File - Open", a new window will appear. Click on "PID" to search by patient id, Oasys will return any records with a Patient ID that contains the text. Eg, searching for "89" will match "893", "389" and so on. Similar things apply for the name, company and date. You can also paste in a list of Patient Id's "PID List" from other programs and search for them all at once. Clicking "Mine" and then "Go" will return all records that you have saved.

After searching Oasys will list all the matching records at the bottom of the window. Double clicking on one of these will open it. You can then click on "View - Data Sheet" to [add / modify data](/documentation/data-sheet) or "View - Report" to look at the [Oasys report](/documentation/oasys-report) on the record. You can select multiple records and then click "Open" to open more than one at a time.

Some details from the current record (name, start date etc) are always displayed on the toolbar of the main screen. If you have more than one record open you can choose the one to look at by clicking on these details and choosing from the list.
