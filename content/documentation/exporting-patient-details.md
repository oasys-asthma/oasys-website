The best way to share records with co workers is to share your patient details file (so that they can see and update the personally identifiable details for patients), and to assign them permissions. Please see the link below for more information.

Sharing / Transporting your Patient Details

Sometimes you may wish to share records externallly, say by email, for example to get an opinion from a colleague in another hospital. In this case you can export a new patient details file which can then be emailed. You can choose to anonymise the details to preserve confidentiality.

There are two ways to create a patient details file. This page is about exporting details for any / all of your records. The other method involves exporting details for records that you have open, please click on [exporting patient details for open records](/documentation/exporting-patient-details-open-files)for more information on this. 

If the records that you want to export are not already open in Oasys then this method is quicker.

To begin click on "Tools - Export Patient Details" from the main menu. A new window will appear showing a list of all the records in your patient details file along with an options to anonymise them.

Tick on all the records that you wish to export, if you start typing the name / ID of a patient then Oasys will go to the next matching record as you type. Tick the anonymisation option as desired, choose the name of the file to export to and click on "Ok". A new patient details file will be created which you can then email to a colleague. 

When anonymising records Oasys: removes the middle names and workplace for a patient; removes the patient id and replaces it with a number; sets the first name and surname to "Anonymous", sets the height to zero and the date of birth to 01/01/3000.
