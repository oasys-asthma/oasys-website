The Oasys report shows the results of the Oasys Analysis of the record. Computer analysis can never replace an expert opinion and for this reason the Oasys scores of occupational asthma make up only a small part of the report. Much of the rest of the report shows graphs that we find useful in diagnosing occupational asthma.

To open the report click on "View - Report"

The report is also the place to [add comments](/documentation/adding-comments) and [add opinions](/documentation/adding-opinions).

The Oasys report has 5 sections, and each one has its own dedicated page, linked below.

- The [Daily Maximum, Minimum and Mean Graph](/documentation/daily-graph)
- The ["2 Hourly" Time of Day Graphs](/documentation/time-of-day-graphs)
- The ["2 Hourly" Time from Waking Graphs]](/documentation/time-from-waking-graphs)
- The [Shift Trend Graphs]](/documentation/shift-trend-graphs)
- The [Conclusions]](/documentation/conclusions)

Each page of the report can be copied and then pasted into other applications. Click anywhere on a page of the report and then click on "Edit - Copy". A message will appear telling you the dimensions of the graph. Simply open the other program and paste in the picture. The picture is copied as a metafile, or .emf (as opposed to a .jpg, .gif etc) and some programs like to be told the original size of the image, which is why you are shown the message.
