description: "How to ask a patient to perform a serial peak flow record"
---

Many people think that it is impossible to get patients to record their peak flow every 2 hours, from waking to sleeping for 4 weeks. However we find that when asking patients by post the return rate is 56%, and this increases to 85% if we are able to talk to the patient in person. Completing a serial peak flow record is inconvenient, but most patients are keen to find out the cause of their problem and are more than willing to do it.

When asking patients to complete a peak flow record it is important to emphasize the following points.

 - The patient name / id should be on every page.
 - The date should be written down every day.
 - Good peak flow technique is important. This can be described by post and should be checked if seeing the patient in person.
 - At least 3 blows are needed each time. If the best two readings are more than 20 l/min apart then the patient should do more blows until the top two are less than 20 l/min apart.
 - Only the best blow should be written down on the sheet.
 - If the patient does different jobs or works in different areas this should be recorded on the sheet.
 - Any asthma medication should be written down on each sheet.
 - Missing the odd reading here and there is not a problem.

We give patients:
- A [data entry sheet for recording peak flow](/pdfs/oasys-data-entry-form.pdf)
- An [annotated example version of the sheet](/pdfs/oasys-annotated-data-entry-form.pdf)
- A [video explaining how to take the readings and fill in the form](https://youtu.be/0TXRzSwzrPA).

We also give patients specific instructions for the type of meter they will be using:

- Instructions for the [Mini-Wright Meter](/pdfs/oasys-mini-wright-instructions.pdf)
- Instructions for the [Mini-Wright Digital Meter](/pdfs/oasys-mini-wright-digital-instructions.pdf)
