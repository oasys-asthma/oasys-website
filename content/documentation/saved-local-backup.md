Records are saved locally when you are saving a record but there is a problem with the Oasys Server (maybe it has gone down, maybe your internet connection has stopped working and so you can't connect, etc, etc)

To make sure that you don't lose any work that you have done the record is saved on your hard disk and is saved to the Oasys Server next time you log on. You can also click on "Tools - Save local backups" from the main menu to do this at any time.

If one of your colleagues opens this same record at this point they will only see the old version and will not be able to see any changes you have made, so you should try and save these local backups as soon as possible. Also, if they make changes to the record and save them then your version will overwrite their changes when you make the save.
