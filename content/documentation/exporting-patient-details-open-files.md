The best way to share records with co workers is to share your patient details file (so that they can see and update the personally identifiable details for patients), and to assign them permissions. Please see the link below for more information.

Sharing / Transporting your Patient Details

Sometimes you may wish to share records externallly, say by email, for example to get an opinion from a colleague in another hospital. In this case you can export a new patient details file which can then be emailed. You can choose to anonymise the details to preserve confidentiality.

There are two ways to create a patient details file. This page is about exporting details for records that you currently have open in Oasys. The other method involves choosing from a list of all your records, please click on [exporting patient details](/documentation/exporting-patient-details) for more information on this. 

If you already have the records open that you want to export then this method is quicker as you don't need to spend time choosing them from the list.

To begin click on "Tools - Export Patient Details for all Open Records" from the main menu. A new window will appear showing an option to anonymise the records. Tick the option as desired, choose the name of the file to export to and click on "Ok". A new patient details file will be created which you can then send to a colleague.
