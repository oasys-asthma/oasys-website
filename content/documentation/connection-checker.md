The Oasys program needs to communicate with the Oasys server to login, open / save records and suchlike. It is designed to be as firewall friendly as possible, and works "out of the box" with the default windows firewall settings.

However, some firewalls, especially some of the stricter corporate ones, can interfere with the operation of Oasys. It is also possible to have other, non firewall based, connection issues.

Oasys has a "Connection Checker" that can help with connection problems.

To open the connection checker - click on "Tools - Connection Checker" from the main menu.

It will attempt to connect to the internet (to check that you have internet access), then attempt to connect to the Oasys website (to check that the Oasys website is working) and the to send a message to the Oasys Server (mainly to check firewall settings).

If the last test fails then please get in touch with your IT department. If you demonstrate the problem to them they will probably know what to do, but if not they are welcome to get in touch with us using the contact page.

If these tests all pass and you are still having trouble, then please get in touch using the contact page. 

You can also click on the "URL of the Oasys Server" link and make sure that it is set correctly in the options.
