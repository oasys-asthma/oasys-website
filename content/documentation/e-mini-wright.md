First of all you will need to export the readings from the E Mini Wright and save them to your computer.

To import readings from the E Mini Wright meter first open the  data sheet, either by creating a new record  or by opening an existing one and then clicking on "View - Data Sheet" from the main menu.

Once in the data sheet click on the "Import Readings" button in the bottom left of the data sheet, and then on "From eMini-Wright".

Once you have pressed the button a new window will appear. Click on "Import Readings from E Mini Wright", and choose the file that you exported.

Oasys will show you some details (for example about how many readings were imported). Click on "Finished" and you will return to the Data Sheet, which will be positioned to show the imported readings.
