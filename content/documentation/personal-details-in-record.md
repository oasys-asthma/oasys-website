The Oasys database is anonymous and all identifiable details are stripped from a record before it is sent to the Oasys Server. However, there are some parts of Oasys where free text can be entered (Comments and opinions mainly). Users must be careful not to put any identifiable information into these.

If Oasys finds personal details in these fields in will refuse to save the record. To rectify simply remove the identifiable details.

Please note that it is possible to enter personal details that Oasys cannot detect. Please do not do this. Users are responsible for looking after their patients / workers confidentiality.
